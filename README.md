# SuperForth
## About
A minimal, performant, strongly-typed, and functional programming language focused on being practical and pragmatic, yet powerful enough to create readable, performant and concise code for any problem. While SuperForth has as much to do with Forth as Javascript has with Java, it shares the same minimalist, performance oriented approach and philosophy. 

## Features
* A strong, impecable type system.
* Support for first class functions.
* Structured programming, with some OOP features like inheritance. 
  * The linking process is done automatically - theres no need for c-like forward declarations.
  * While casting is done automatically from derived types to their super type, downcasting is not allowed. 
* Type arguments, not only for structs but for functions as well.
